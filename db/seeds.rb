# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: "Project 1",  { name: "Project 1",  }])
#   Mayor.create(name: "Project 1", ity: cities.first)
